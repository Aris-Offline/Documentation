# CommandBar

We're still working on this, coming soon!

The CommandBar simplifies the creation of basic app bars by providing:
- Automatic layout of commands, with primary commands on the right and secondary commands on the left.
- Automatic resizing of app bar commands when the app size changes.\nWhen you need an app bar that contains only AppBarButton,AppBarToggleButton, and AppBarSeparator controls, use a CommandBar. 

If you need more complex content, such as images, progress bars, or text blocks, use an AppBar control.
