# Theme Schemes (theme mode)

Windows apps can use a light or dark application theme. The theme affects the colors of the app's background, text, icons, and common controls.

:::info

This article is about theme modes (light/dark). If you want to know about accent colors (aka primary color), please see [Accent Color](./accent-color).

## Available Schemes

All controls comes with two palette modes: light (the default) and dark.

### Light

The light theme is the default theme mode. It is the most commonly used theme mode and designed to be easy on the eyes and provide a good contrast between the background and foreground colors. The light theme is suitable for most applications and is recommended for applications that are used in well-lit environments, also recommended for applications that are used by people with visual impairments.

### Dark

The dark theme is designed to be easy on the eyes in low-light environments. It provides a high contrast between the background and foreground colors, making it easier to read text and see icons. The dark theme is recommended for applications that are used in low-light environments, such as at night or in dark rooms.

## Change default value

By default, your Windows app's theme is the userâ€™s theme preference from Windows Settings or the device's default theme. However, you can set the theme specifically for your Windows app.

### With ThemeResources (static and globally)

When you use a global **ThemeResources**, you may find out that there's a property called **RequestedTheme**. You can use this property to set the default theme mode for your app in XAML. The example `App.xaml` should look like this:

```ini
RequestedTheme="Dark"
```

```xml
<Application x:Class="WpfApp1.App"
             xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
             xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
             xmlns:local="clr-namespace:WpfApp1" 
             xmlns:ui="http://schemas.inkore.net/lib/ui/wpf/modern"
             StartupUri="MainWindow.xaml">
    <Application.Resources>
        <ResourceDictionary>
            <ResourceDictionary.MergedDictionaries>
                <ui:ThemeResources RequestedTheme="Dark"/>
                <ui:XamlControlsResources/>
            </ResourceDictionary.MergedDictionaries>
        </ResourceDictionary>
    </Application.Resources>
</Application>
```

If you want to follow the system settings, you can do this, or simply do nothing:

```ini
RequestedTheme="{x:Null}"
```

### With ThemeManager.Current (dynamically and globally)

When you want to dynamically change the theme scheme, you can use the **ThemeManager.Current.ApplicationTheme** property like this:

```csharp
ThemeManager.Current.ApplicationTheme = ApplicationTheme.Dark;
```

For example, here's how a theme toggle button is implemented:

```xml
<Button x:Name="Button_ToggleTheme" Content="Toggle Theme" Click="Button_ToggleTheme_Click"/>
```

```csharp
private void Button_ToggleTheme_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    if (ThemeManager.Current.ApplicationTheme == ApplicationTheme.Dark)
    {
        ThemeManager.Current.ApplicationTheme = ApplicationTheme.Light;
    }
    else
    {
        ThemeManager.Current.ApplicationTheme = ApplicationTheme.Dark;
    }
}
```

If you want to follow the system settings, you can do this, or simply do nothing:

```csharp
ThemeManager.Current.ApplicationTheme = null;
```

### With ThemeManager attached property (locally)

When you want to dynamically change the theme scheme for a specific control, you can use the **ThemeManager.Theme** attached property like this:

```ini
ui:ThemeManager.RequestedTheme="Dark"
```

Try this example in your project:

```xml
<ui:SimpleStackPanel Orientation="Horizontal" Spacing="10">
    <Border ui:ThemeManager.RequestedTheme="Light">
        <ui:SimpleStackPanel Margin="10" Spacing="10">
            <Button Content="Normal controls"/>
            <CheckBox Content="in light mode!"/>
        </ui:SimpleStackPanel>
    </Border>
    <Border ui:ThemeManager.RequestedTheme="Dark" Grid.Column="1"
        Background="{DynamicResource {x:Static ui:ThemeKeys.ApplicationPageBackgroundThemeBrushKey}}">
        <ui:SimpleStackPanel Margin="10" Spacing="10">
            <Button Content="Dark controls"/>
            <CheckBox Content="in light mode!"/>
        </ui:SimpleStackPanel>
    </Border>
</ui:SimpleStackPanel>
```

If you want to follow the system settings, you can do this, or simply do nothing:

```ini
ui:ThemeManager.RequestedTheme="Default"
```

## Remarks

### Default value

If you don't specify the theme scheme or you set the default values, the application will follow the system settings.

:::warn Sometimes NOT

There are a few scenarios that the app cannot follow the system settings, mostly because the WinRT settings reader doesn't work for some reasons:

- The app is running on Windows 7/8/8.1, or older versions of Windows 10;

- In the project settings, the target OS version is lower than `windows10.0.18362.0`.
