(This document is dated on 10/02/2020 but actually it was committed on 07/17/2021.)

The underlying values of key constants, DWMWA_WINDOW_CORNER_PREFERENCE and DWM_WINDOW_CORNER_PREFERENCE enumeration, can be found in dwmapi.h included in Windows Insider Preview SDK.

When rounded corners are applied to a window, a gray outline is automatically added.

On version 10.0.22000.100, anti-aliasing is not applied to the rounded corners and they show noticeable jaggies (except those of standard title bar).
