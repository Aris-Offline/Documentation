**Value**: 3

Acrylic is a semi-transparent material that replicates the effect of frosted glass. In Windows 11, acrylic has been updated to be brighter and more translucent, allowing for a stronger contextual relationship with the visuals behind it.

Mica Alt (aka. Tabbed) is a variant of Mica, with stronger tinting of the user's desktop background color. You can apply Mica Alt to your app's backdrop to provide a deeper visual hierarchy than Mica, especially when creating an app with a tabbed title bar. Mica Alt is available for apps that use Windows App SDK 1.1 or later, while running on Windows 11 version 22000 or later.

Though bothe Acrylic10 and Acrylic11 give you the similar look and feel, they are using different APIs. Acrylic10 is using the older API and Acrylic11 is using the newer API and the have some differences.

|                   | Acrylic10                                                            | Acrylic11                                                                           |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Availability      | <font color="seagreen">Windows 10 and 11 (Windows 10.0.17063+)</font>                              | Windows 11 (Windows 10.0.22523+)                                                    |
| Performance       | Laggy when resizing the window                                       |  <font color="seagreen">Looks okay resizing the window</font>                                                      |
| Customizations    | <font color="seagreen">Customizabe tint color (use ui:WindowHelper.Acrylic10Color property)</font> | Nothing                                                                             |
| Transitions       | Nothing                                                              | <font color="seagreen">Both switching light/dark and focused/unfocused will display a transition animation</font> |
| When losing focus | <font color="seagreen">Acrylic effect remains</font>                                               | Acrylic effect temporarily disabled                                                 |

As the table shows, both the two Acrylic effects have their own pros and cons. You can choose the one that fits your needs.

### Mica and Tabbed

Mica and Tabbed are similar in terms of appearance, but they have different purposes. Mica is used for general windows, while Tabbed is used for windows with a root TabControl.

These images show the difference between Mica and Mica Alt in a title bar with tabs. The first image uses Mica and the second image uses Mica Alt.
