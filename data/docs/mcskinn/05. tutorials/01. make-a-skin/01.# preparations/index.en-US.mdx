# Preparations

## Before We Begin

This series of documents will guide you through building your own Minecraft skin from scratch. First, you need to ensure that your MCSkinn is correctly configured and the skin library folder is set up. If not, please refer to [here](../../overview). If you're ready, scroll down. After these tasks, you'll (definitely) be delighted to see your creativity come to life in MCSkinn!

You don't always have to follow the steps in the document verbatim. Adding your own creativity and understanding will be more beneficial in creating a unique skin!

## Create a new skin

In the "File" menu bar, you'll see a "Skin" button. Click on it, and a popup window will appear.

*A configured skin selector.*

The left pane of the selector displays various skin models in Minecraft. Typically, you just need to navigate to the "Player" folder and choose from there.

There are 5 types of skins under the "Player" folder. The Cape type is for capes, while Steve and Alex types control the thickness of your skin's arms. The (Minimal) suffix controls the layers of your skin (single or double). Unless your skin needs to be compatible with Minecraft versions older than 1.8, we don't recommend using single-layer skins.

On the right side of the selector are some related options. The "Blank" and "Local File" tabs control whether you're creating a new skin directly or opening an existing skin file. Under the "Blank" tab, there's a checkbox for "Enable Template", disabling which will fill each part of your skin with a different color of translucent color, like this:

*Steve skin style when the template is disabled.*

Enabling this option will display your skin as the default skin type.

At the bottom is the path where your skin will be created, it's recommended not to change it.

After selecting all the options, click "Create", and you'll see a skin ready for editing.
