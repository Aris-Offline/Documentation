# Drawing the Body

Similar to the head, the number of pixels available for drawing the body is very limited. Also, since only 2 skin layers can be used, try not to make the skin too complex.

## First Layer

It's important to note that skin clothing usually needs to coordinate with the body and limbs, so leave space for the limbs when drawing.

When it comes to color, you can use low-saturation colors and avoid using colors too similar to the hair color.

Start by roughly conceptualizing the type, structure, and color of the clothing. For reference, you can sketch your ideas on paper (or elsewhere) before drawing the clothing.

Draw the basic style of the clothing. At this point, you can use the "Lighten/Darken" tool to sketch out the approximate folds of the clothing. Then, (similar to the head) add shadows around the folds using the same method (the shadows should have layers).

If your clothing has prominent decorations, you can make the clothing look more natural by adding shadows around them (or underneath).

Then refine using the "Lighten/Darken" tool, add highlights, and use the "Noise" tool appropriately.

On the sides, let the colors flow from the front, and darken the middle part.

The bottom and sides should be treated similarly, flowing from the front. But because these parts are generally not visible in the game, you can keep them simpler.

The back varies depending on the clothing style, but generally, follow the folds seen from the side and front. Then, refine using the same approach, but add shadows near the head to simulate changes in light caused by shadows.

## Second Layer

The second layer can be considered the finishing touch of the clothing. It can bring depth to the overall skin.

Different clothing and styles will bring different effects, so make judgments based on the specific skin style.
