Select the empty skin (the gray one), and click **Choose New Skin**, then select your PNG file in the file manager. After loading, select the right model, and, everything is done!

You will now be able to see the new skin on your character whenever you boot up Minecraft. The new skin might be covered by armor for some players, and you might have to remove it to properly test it out.
