# Express your mind

Many people just want to customize a skin for their favorite character, but because they can't find it on the Internet, they have to create it themselves, which makes the restoration of the character particularly crucial.

## How to express what you want to express?

The most significant part of skin design is the need for people to be instantly recognizable to the character, which is crucial under a constrained grid and pixels. Since skins are often low in pixels and can present limited information, they need to subtly convey what they want in a limited space.

How do you present what you need in a limited space? The answer is to cut out unnecessary details and enhance the character's identity. In other words, in the creative process, all we need is to remove unnecessary details and highlight the distinguishing features of the character.

When creating fanart for pixel art, we can't try to include all the details, because pixels have limited information. Therefore, we need to extract the main features from the original image so that even if the style is different, it can be seen that it is the same character.

People first have to see what the author is drawing, and then whether the painting is good or not.

If you add too many elements, or even simply reduce the resolution of the HD image and paste it, you will not be able to see what is drawn, which requires special attention.

## How to practice

### Let others know what you're making

Just as getting the shape right is the foundation of art, so is knowing what you're drawing, highlighting the features and ignoring the unnecessary details to show on the skin.

### Adjust the color

Never use a color dropper tool when learning the skills and try to tune it out through the hue ring as much as possible, try to ensure that the color you mix is the same as the color of the object you are drawing.

### Something else

Draw what you like, and if you can't think of what you want to draw, you can go to your favorite character and turn it into a Minecraft skin. See some excellent works and have a comparison.

It is recommended to improve the aesthetics while drawing the skin, exercise the perception of color, and learn some post-art software, such as Photoshop and Illustrator.

When drawing, you should always keep learning, find the problems of the previous work and correct the next work, so as to improve.

Don't be too utilitarian as a beginner, having no highlights doesn't mean that your work is not good.
