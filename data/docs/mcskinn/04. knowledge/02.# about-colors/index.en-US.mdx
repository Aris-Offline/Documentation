# Colors and Toning

The skin is made through the combination of colors, and there is almost no sketch, so whether the color is beautiful or not becomes the key to the skin. If you want to do a good toning, you first need to know more about colors.

## Elements of Color

**The three elements of color**: hue, lightness, and purity (called HSV in the software). Hue determines the basic color of a color, e.g. the overall blue/reddish/yellow color of this thing. Brightness determines the brightness of the color, for example, the pale yellow in gouache painting is lemon yellow and white. Purity determines the vividness of the color, and in many cases, the so-called "color is not clear enough" is caused by too little purity. And if these things are combined to form a ring, it will look like the picture below:

By matching colors appropriately, you can create colors that are comfortable and beautiful.

## What colors are more comfortable

There is no such thing as beauty or ugliness in a single color, but whether it looks good or not depends mainly on the combination of colors. Each combination has its own unique effect.

Although there are many aesthetically pleasing combinations, there are also commonalities to the inappropriate combinations, like large areas of overly bright or dull colors, chaotic color layouts, etc. Here is an example of a not-so-good example, and how to correct these mistakes:

*Some bad ang good example of toning*

Let's see the three examples in the picture above. Do not imitate the first one and second one.

<span style={{ color: 'darkred', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Example 1:</span>
 Too much noise applied, too bright colors, the hair color is too close to the shirt color, the second layer is not used, inside faces are not painted and a terrible red lip.


<span style={{ color: 'darkred', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Example 2:</span> No light and dark faces, no details, lack of layering.


<span style={{ color: 'green', fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Example 3:</span> Correct light and dark faces, enough details, and right color scheme. However, overly bright lips are still not worth imitating.

In addition, the color should not be too bright or too heavy (too saturated), such as bright red or deep black.
