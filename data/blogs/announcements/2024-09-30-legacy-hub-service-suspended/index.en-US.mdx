# iNKORE Hub (Legacy) Service Disruption and Future Plans

Dear Valued Users,

We regret to inform you that due to recent restrictions and unstablility on the iNKORE Hub servers, you may experience difficulties in downloading and using services that depend on iNKORE Hub, such as MCSkinn Legacy. The timeline for when these services will be fully restored remains uncertain at this moment.

In response to this situation, we are taking significant measures to ensure the continued availability and improvement of our services. Our development team is currently in the process of entirely restructuring MCSkinn, Inkways and iNKORE Hub. We will be adopting a new technology stack that promises enhanced stability and a richer feature set. This change aims to prevent similar issues from arising in the future and to provide you with a more robust and comprehensive platform.

Furthermore, the existing iNKORE Hub will be officially discontinued and replaced with a new service, which will be announced in the near future. We are committed to making this transition as smooth as possible for our users, and we will provide detailed instructions on how to migrate your data to the new platform. The Legacy (Current one) Hub will finally be shut down after the new service is launched and the migration process is completed.

We appreciate your understanding and patience during this transitional period. Please stay tuned for further updates as we work diligently to bring these enhancements to fruition.

Thank you for your continued support.

Sincerely,
iNKORE Studios
