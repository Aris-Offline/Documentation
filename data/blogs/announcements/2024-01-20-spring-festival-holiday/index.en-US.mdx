Dear friends,

Your continuous support and love have been the driving force behind our constant progress. We are deeply grateful and extend our most sincere thanks. As the Chinese New Year approaches, in order to allow everyone to fully rest and enjoy the festival, our studio has decided to enter a holiday period from **January 26, 2024** to **February 24, 2024**.

{/* truncate */}

During this period, all of our products and services will suspend regular maintenance work, which means that there may be a time when you cannot enjoy our timely updates and technical support. At the same time, please understand that due to our vacation, the response to your work emails and messages may be slightly delayed, but we will handle and respond as soon as possible after the holiday ends.

Taking this opportunity, we would like to wish you and your family a happy Spring Festival in advance! May this Chinese New Year bring you endless joy and warmth, and in the new year, health and prosperity to you!

Once again, thank you for your support and trust. We look forward to reuniting after the holiday and returning with greater enthusiasm, better products and services to meet every user's expectation.

Best regards,
Your loyal partner, iNKORE!
