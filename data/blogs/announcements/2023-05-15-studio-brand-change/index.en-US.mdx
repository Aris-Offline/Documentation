# Studio Brand Change Notice

We are pleased to announce that our studio has officially changed its name from *ANIMASTER Studios* to **iNKORE! (iNKORE Studios)**, effective from May 16th, 2023.

This change is due to the expansion of our business and the need to better reflect our brand identity. We would like to take this opportunity to express our sincere thanks to all of our customers, suppliers, and employees for their continued support and trust over the years.

We understand that this change may have some impact on our current agreements, projects, and financial statements. However, we will do our utmost to minimize any inconvenience caused to our partners and will work closely with them to ensure a smooth transition.

Starting from June 1st, 2023, all official documents, contracts, and communications will be conducted under the new name of iNKORE! (iNKORE Studios). We will notify all our stakeholders of this change via email, phone, and mail.

The new name, iNKORE Studios, represents our commitment to innovation, quality, and customer service. We believe that this new name reflects our vision and mission more accurately, and we are confident that it will help us achieve greater success in the future.

We would like to thank you once again for your understanding, and we look forward to continuing our relationship with you under the new name of iNKORE!.

Our main website domain will also be changed from animasterstudios.com to inkore.net. The redirection might exist for period, until we no longer own the domain ~~animasterstudios.com~~. However, we recommend you update your bookmarks (if you have) to reflect the new name.

Best regards,
NotYoojun.! from iNKORE Studios
